    - Tubbataha Reef on board Expedition Fleet
    - ""
    - |-
      Measuring 99,600 hectares in size, the Tubbataha Reef National Park is made up of 2 atolls rising in the middle of the Sulu Sea. Being almost a hundred nautical miles from the nearest port, access is only through Liveaboard vessels and voyages to the park are determined by the weather. A small window-from late March to early June when calm seas and clear skies are the best and only times for divers to visit. The strong winds and rough swells the rest of the year deters both authorized and un-authorized incursions into the park and permits the reef to settle back into its natural state of regeneration.
      
      Embarkation and disembarkation point is Puerto Princesa (Palawan). To get there, take one of the domestic flights from Manila.
