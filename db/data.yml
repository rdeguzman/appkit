    - Tubbataha Reef on board Expedition Fleet
    - ""
    - |-
      Measuring 99,600 hectares in size, the Tubbataha Reef National Park is made up of 2 atolls rising in the middle of the Sulu Sea. Being almost a hundred nautical miles from the nearest port, access is only through Liveaboard vessels and voyages to the park are determined by the weather. A small window-from late March to early June when calm seas and clear skies are the best and only times for divers to visit. The strong winds and rough swells the rest of the year deters both authorized and un-authorized incursions into the park and permits the reef to settle back into its natural state of regeneration.
      
      Embarkation and disembarkation point is Puerto Princesa (Palawan). To get there, take one of the domestic flights from Manila.

      Cebu, Known as the Queen of the South, this historic island province in the Philippines is renowned for its stunning natural beaches, sweet mangoes, charming Buri furniture, traditional jewelry and year-round tropical climate.
      
      Most appealing of all is the island's accessible location, just a short flight from Manila, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and Japan. And, a mere 15 minutes drive from the island's airport lies the paradise of Shangri-La's Mactan Resort & Spa.

    - Travel Tips
    - ""
    - "TO SAVE on luggage space, roll your clothes instead of laying them flat. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      ALWAYS keep some loose change in your pocket. So you can get around even by tricycles. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      ALWAYS bring tissue paper in your travel. It can be used in 101 ways. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      NEVER hesitate to ask locals for help or direction. They are always ready to help a traveler in distress.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      ONE of the sterling virtues of a traveler is PATIENCE \r\n\
      \r\n\
      WHEN going to Sagada, the best attraction to visit is the Big Cave (or Sumaging Cave). Be ready for some adventure! Its unique attraction though are the easily reached Hanging Coffins.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      TO AVOID creasing your clothes put each clothing inside a plastic. You can also roll it to save on luggage space.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      NEVER enter a cave without a guide. Caves can be very dangerous to the brave, but stupid.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      WHEN you see cute children while traveling, NEVER give them token coins or candies. It will damage their moral values.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      NEVER tempt locals by leaving your things unattended.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      WHEN traveling, dress lightly. Its not practical to bring heavy clothes.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      ALWAYS pay when the service is done. AS much as possible, never pay your guides in advance.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      WHEN crossing a road for the first time, observe first the locals. You may get caught jaywalking!\r\n\
      \r\n\
      WHEN exploring a cave, always bring at least 3 sources of light for your safety.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      WHEN traveling for a long period, go to the dentist first. A toothache can ruin a great vacation. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      AVOID staying under the tropical sun for long periods. Too much sun can actually cook you skin! One or two hours should be enough for good sun bathing. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      ALWAYS bring a cap when discovering places, especially during the summer months.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      IT'S ALWAYS better to smile and greet the locals you encounter. It makes your travel more positive.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      WHEN going for long walks, its best to bring an umbrella. It can significantly  lessen exhaustion from heat.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      YOU should bring basic medicines when you travel. These are for colds, stomach cramps, and fever.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      ONE of the most useful things to have in travel is a malong. It can be used as a blanket, a beach apparel, or a simple body cover.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      INSTEAD of a lot of cash, bring an ATM card. Most of the destinations in the Philippines already have ATM machines. Just a heads up, though - some machines charge Php150 for the use of foreign-issued cards.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      DON'T forget to bring a good pair of slippers when traveling.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      SHOULD you eat exotic food offered to you? Why not? They\xE2\x80\x99re made of the same organic compounds as the beef or vegetables we eat. Besides, its not good shaming a host. But if its made of endangered animal like the sea turtle or deer meat, then have the moral obligation to say no.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      IF YOU'RE not used to it, avoid eating coconut and drinking its juice in the morning. It may cause you great stomach discomfort.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      TO GET a taste of authentic Filipino food, try to get invited to eat inside a local\xE2\x80\x99s home.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      FOR THE girls, try not to wear very skimpy clothing while walking the streets of a rural area. The locals may not find it proper.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      YOU CAN actually do the whale shark interaction even if you don\xE2\x80\x99t know how to swim. I personally brought a number of non-swimmer who were initially terrified of the water. I told them that their life vests won\xE2\x80\x99t let them drown even if they wanted to. Then they immensely enjoyed swimming (while being pulled by the interaction officer) with the giants.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      REMEMBER: you may have different culture from the people in the places you visit. Try your very best to tuck your dissenting opinions to yourself to keep your host AND yourself happy. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      PLEASE do not collect sand from Boracay (or any other beach!) as souvenir. Its sugary white sand is almost irreplaceable.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      ALWAYS keep a plastic bag tucked somewhere in your bag. It can save your camera or cell phone in case of sudden rains.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      NEVER feed wild animals. They can become aggressive and may hurt you.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      TO SAVE on hired transportation expenses, try to get others who are planning to travel the same way as you.\r\n"

    - Travel Trivia

    - "Some trivia on the Philippines which should make your travel more interesting -----\r\n\
      \r\n\
      THE largest city in the world is Puerto Princesa City in Palawan.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      DID you know that we have otters in the Philippines? The river otters can be found in Palawan.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      DID you know that the legend of mermaids came about because the sailors in olden times mistook some dugongs, or sea cows, as women with fins?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      THE Philippines has giant rats that are as big as cats! But they\xE2\x80\x99re very gentle and cute, and are called cloud rats. Try to imagine a giant hamster. However, there are already a few of them left. They live mostly in mossy forests.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      DID u know that the huge bats like the ones in Subic are very gentle? And that they pollinate flowers of huge trees like the Durian?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      DID you know that with only 100 pesos, you could already have a good tour of Metro Manila? Get on the MRT and LRTs! They\xE2\x80\x99re conveniently interconnected. But make sure you time your travel between 10:00 A.M. \xE2\x80\x93 3:00 P.M. to avoid the humungous amount of people trying to fit into the trains during rush hours.\r\n\

    - Puerto Princesa, Palawan
    - ""
    - "Always touted as the last frontier of the Philippines, the island province of Palawan holds true to that reputation.  This area is considered as one of the few dream destinations for many seasoned and would-be travelers. With more than a thousand islands, islets, cays and shoals and matched by impressive limestone cliffs, excellent coral reefs, cultures and other interesting natural treasures, I recommend that you allot at least three to four days of your entire lifetime to visit the attractions in Palawan.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      For a great taste of the destination, you can try this already-proven itinerary.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      DAY 1 ---     \r\n\
      6:00 A.M.  - ETD Manila \r\n\
      \r\n\
      7:00  A.M. -  ETA Puerto Princesa City. Take a tricycle or get to a service vehicle; Check-in Hotel or Lodging House; Breakfast\r\n\
      \r\n\
      After Breakfast - Hire a tricycle or a service vehicle for a city tour\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Visit the following:\r\n\
      Butterfly Farm - This is a private lot that was converted into a butterfly farm where one can see butterflies in all stages of their lives. Adult butterflies flutter about in a landscaped garden where tourists can freely walk.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Iwahig Penal Colony - This is actually a prison area where the inmates are given the chance to become farmers and workers in the sprawling territory. A visitor can buy handicrafts made by the prisoners.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Crocodile Farm - A different kind of farm where crocodiles are kept in captivity to help their species survive in the Philippines. More than 500 crocodiles call this home. Visitors can see the skeleton of a huge man-eater that gobbled up people in the past. They will also be given lectures on the ecological importance of crocodiles and later, made to walk on  steel boardwalks located on top of crocodile pens. Have some pesos ready for a photo opportunity while holding a baby croc and buying some souvenir items made out of crocodile teeth.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Late P.M. - Back to Accommodation; Rest; Dinner (Accommodation or city restaurant) Recommended:  Kaluis, Kinabuch; OVN\r\n\
      \r\n\
      DAY 2     \r\n\
      Early A.M. - Proceed to Honda Bay by hired tricycle or service vehicle (must have packed lunch)\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Honda Bay is one of the must-visit destinations in Puerto Princesa. It has numerous small islands that are usually ringed by white sands. Get ready to have tanned skin under the sun while having the time of your life swimming, snorkeling and sun bathing.\r\n\
      \t\t\t\t\r\n\
      Whole Day - Island Hopping (Snake Island, Pandan Island, Any other island in the area)\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Late P.M. - Back to city proper; OVN\r\n\
      \r\n\
      !! Make sure that you have somebody to get a permit to enter the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in the city!! Or else, you may not be able to enter the cave if you don\xE2\x80\x99t have the permit. Better get it on your first day.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      DAY 3  \r\n\
      7:00 A.M. - Proceed to Sabang for a visit to St. Paul Subterranean River National Park (okay, Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park).  Either hire an FX or service vehicle.\r\n\

      \t\t\r\n\
      Take boat back to Sabang. If you want to walk in the tropical and limestone jungle, a good option is to walk the 4-kilometer jungle trail back to Sabang. You will pass through limestones where wooden paths are built over forests, and tiny beach coves. Make sure to ask around first if the trail is okay (the wooden paths may be under repair, etc.)\r\n\
      \r\n\
      2:30 P.M. - ETD Sabang (or 4:00 PM if you opted to trek back)\r\n\

      DAY 4\t\r\n\

      Actually, there is an easy way \xE2\x80\x93 you can buy a lot of items at the souvenir shop beside the airport. You can do this after you have checked-in and while waiting for your flight.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      11:00 A.M. - ETD Puerto Princesa City\r\n\
      \r\n\
      12:00 NN - ETA Manila\r\n\
      \t\t\r\n\
